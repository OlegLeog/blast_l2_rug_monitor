# Blast L2 Rug Scanner ☠️

Live honeypot & rug detector on Blast — catches freshly deployed scam tokens with:
- < 50 holders
- absurdly low supply
- instant liquidity adds

These are the contracts that steal your ETH in one click.

### Why this matters
99% of Blast "gems" that go 1000x are actually exit liquidity for the dev.  
This script shows you the trash before you ape it.

```bash
python blast_l2_rug_monitor.py
